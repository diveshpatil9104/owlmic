# Installing Owlmic on Android

The Owlmic Android app acts as the client hardware sensor. It captures pristine audio from your phone's microphone array and high-definition video from your rear or front cameras, transmitting both to your PC in real-time.

## 4. Battery & Background Optimization (Important)

Owlmic uses an Android Foreground Service with an ongoing notification to ensure smooth, un-interrupted streaming even when you switch to other apps or turn the screen off.

However, aggressive OEM battery management (such as Samsung One UI, Xiaomi MIUI/HyperOS, Huawei EMUI, or OnePlus OxygenOS) may attempt to kill background networking.

To prevent disconnections:
1. Long-press the **Owlmic** app icon on your home screen -> tap the **(i)** Info icon.
2. Tap **Battery** or **App battery usage**.
3. Select **Unrestricted** (or "Don't optimize").
4. Ensure **Allow background activity** is enabled.
